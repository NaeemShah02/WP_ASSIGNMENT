The road leading to Skardu Valley is said to be the World’s Eighth Wonder, as it offers some spectacular vistas as well as the threat of a massive avalanche every time it rains. The valley has a rich cultural and historical heritage, as well as lovely customs. Tibet’s culture and traditions are also comparable. Skardu, on the other hand, lies in the Baltistan area of Gilgit Baltistan, sometimes known as Little Tibet.

                    <h3> Naltar Valley</h3>
                    <p style="color: white;">The valley is surrounded by lush foliage and offers breathtaking vistas. This site may be reached by taking a 45-minute jeep trip from Normal village. However, due to its elevation of 9,700 feet, the temperature in Naltar valley stays frigid. It has a number of attractive places for tourists to visit. Naltar Lake 1 (Satrangi), Pari Lake, Blue Lake, and others are among the finest to visit. During the summer, a large number of tourists flock to such locations to capture their memories. Moreover, throughout the winter, visitors may attend the International Ski Festival in the valley. Make this beautiful destination a part of your summer 2022  trip plans.
    
                        As mentioned earlier that there  are many good real estate investment opportunities in these areas but there are many factors affecting real estate market in Pakistan , so you need to consider these factors before investing in real estate.
                        
                        So Naltar valley is in fourth position in our list of northern areas of Pakistan</p>
